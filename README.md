## 📚 Project Overview – Chat with Multiple PDFs (AI-Powered Document Assistant)

**Chat with Multiple PDFs** is an AI-powered Streamlit web app that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and query their contents conversationally. Built using **LangChain** and vector embeddings, the app enables **multi-document semantic search** and **contextual question answering** — making it an ideal tool for students, researchers, and professionals.

The project demonstrates expertise in large language model integration, vector databases, document chunking, and real-time web interfaces using Python and Streamlit.

## 🧠 Key Technologies & Skills Used

### 🐍 Backend & AI Logic
- **Python** – main language for logic, file handling, and model communication
- **LangChain** – for document loading, splitting, embedding, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **OpenAI API** / **Groq API** *(optional)* – for fast, accurate LLM responses
- **FAISS / ChromaDB** – vector database for embedding-based document retrieval
- **Prompt Engineering** – optimized queries for better user experience

### 📁 PDF Handling
- **PyMuPDF / pdfplumber / pdfminer** – to extract raw text from PDF documents
- **Document Chunking** – breaks long texts into smaller, searchable segments

### 🎨 Frontend / UI
- **Streamlit** – for building an interactive, responsive, and real-time user interface
- **Streamlit File Uploader** – to support multiple PDF uploads
- **Markdown & Code Rendering** – for displaying clean answers

### ☁️ Deployment & Tools
- **Streamlit Cloud** – for hosting and easy sharing
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and collaboration
- **VS Code** – primary development environment
